## About

In this course, we will learn what is AI and how to apply it to multi-omics and other high-dimensional biomedical data.
We will learn how to use [**SIMON**](https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(20)30242-7) – our recently developed open-source software for the application of machine learning to biological and clinical data.

> **Why SIMON:** 
 In SIMON, analysis is performed using an intuitive graphical user interface and standardized, automated machine learning approach allowing non-technical researchers to identify patterns and extract knowledge from high-dimensional data and build thousands of high-quality predictive models using **180+ machine learning algorithms**. With an easy-to-use graphical user interface, standardized pipelines, and automated approach for machine learning and other statistical analysis methods, SIMON helps to identify optimal algorithms and provides a resource that empowers non-technical and technical researchers to identify crucial patterns in biomedical data.
 
If you plan to use machine learning to identify patterns in your data and want to learn more about SIMON and how to use it, you are all invited to join this Oxford Medical Science Division course.
